I've looking for a pic -> pdf converter since I switched to Linux, but the ones out there were online or extremely complicated.
I just needed a converter that allowed me 3 things:
  1- convert imgs to pdf without altering the original files
  2- perform operations in queue
  3- convert entire folders and give names to the final product and put them in the origin folder
And, as I needed it, I thought: Well, i'm a noob programmer, but a programmer after all.
So, I did it, i'm planning to add this little mess some other cool stuff in the future. For now, this is just the script. Isn't usable for everyone yet.
I got to package but, here's the source code if someone cares.
One last thing, Python it's the worst programming language. Thanks.
